# File Organizer

This project is an experiment to use LLM as a general purpose classifier. It reads files in a directory and moves them to a new directory based on the file name, type and content. The destination directory is determined by the LLM model (OpenAI GPT-3.5).

## Usage

As of now, you need to have an OpenAI API key to use this project.

First, install the dependencies with poetry:

```bash
poetry update
```

Then, create a `config.toml` file. You can use `config.toml.example` as a template.

Finally, run the script:

```bash
poetry run start
```

Example output:

```
âžœ  file_organizer git:(main) poetry run start
